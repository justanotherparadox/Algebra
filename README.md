Inequalities:
=============

1. Start from "Inequalities- A Mathematical Olympiad approach" (Uploaded above)

2. You can also refer to these books on the go:
   - [Problem Solving using AM-GM Inequality](https://www.amazon.in/dp/1544675178/?coliid=IUIJESYUOQZS4&colid=22Q8X0SEDYMS3&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) by Yongcheng Chen
   - [Problem Solving using Cauchy's Inequality](https://www.amazon.in/dp/1541000285/?coliid=I2IOECK5VFF542&colid=22Q8X0SEDYMS3&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) by Yongcheng Chen

3. Inequalities by P. P. Korovkin (Uploaded above)

4. [Algebraic Inequalities](https://www.amazon.in/dp/3319778358/?coliid=I1CS7JX8MR28JN&colid=22Q8X0SEDYMS3&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it)

6. The "Cauchy-Schwarz Master Class"  (Uploaded above)

7. Inequalities by Beckenbach and Bellman (Uploaded above) ------> Advanced 

*Note- Inequalities can be applied to real as well as complex variables, matrices, norms , vector spaces, integrals, functions etc. Therefore,the reader is expected to extend those wherever he/she finds necessary.

Apart from above mentioned references, I will be uploading some problem sets from various sources.
